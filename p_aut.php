    <div class="project_description">
      Taking up political philosophy course at Leiden University as part of my individual study track, I was greatly inspired by one of the reading material, namely, R.P.Wolff’s In Defense of Anarchism.
      In this project, I was to map out the key terms of the subject matter, establishing axes between authority–autonomy and the individual–society.
      Furthermore I set to investigate the visual sign and symbol system of military ribbons and insignia, deconstructing their semiotic meaning and reconstructing them again with the use of typography.
