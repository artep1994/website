    <div class="project_description">
      Staging the Absurd is the 9th edition of the Niece Videâ€™s Journal of Humanity. The theme of this edition dealt with absurdism, a phenomenon which is predominantly present in our everyday life. Facebook, Twitter, Youtube vlogs taking the place of traditional media. Strongly biased news reporting seems to be getting more clicks than rational research-based and investigative journalism.

  4 people have been invited to explore the subject of absurdism through their writings, while we have approached the topic through the visual language of memes and graffiti.

  It has been printed in edition of 300 and available for sale through Nieuwe Vide.
